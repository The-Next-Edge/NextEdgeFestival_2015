Adaptive toolbox is a business concept created by Gerd Gigerenzer, and is defined as the ability of an institution or individual to make expedient decisions. The adaptive toolbox employs the theory of Ecological rationality. Businesses or individuals employ the "adaptive toolbox" in order to handle situations of uncertainty involving limited time, computational resources and information. The "content" of the adaptive toolbox is shaped by evolution, learning, and culture for specific domains of inference and reasoning, as well as changes across the life stages . In short, it is a decision-making method that uses an individual's past experiences and problem solving skills to make decisions in an unfamiliar or high-stress environment. Heuristics is another term for these decision-making models.

The adaptive toolbox:

1. The collection of elements (e.g. search rules, stopping rules, decision rules) for constructing heuristics
2. Core mental capacities that building blocks exploit (e.g. recognition memory, depth perception, frequency monitoring, object tracking, ability to imitate)
3. A specific group of rules or heuristics rather than a general-purpose decision-making algorithm. These heuristics are fast, frugal, and computationally cheap, but are less consistent, coherent, and general. Common examples include:
    * Recognition-based heuristics (e.g. Recognition heuristic, fluency heuristic)
    * One-reason decision-making (e.g. Take-the-best, Fast and Frugal Trees)
    * Trade-off heuristics (e.g. 1/N, Tallying)
    * Satisficing heuristics
    * Social heuristics(e.g.tit for tat, imitate-the-majority, imitate-the-successful, default heuristic, social circle heuristic, averaging, choosing)
