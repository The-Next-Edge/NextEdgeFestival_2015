In everyday situations, human beings often need to act on information quickly, in
real time. Gigerenzer et al. (in press) therefore argue that rational decisions are

(1) Bounded. The best-known theory of unbounded rationality would be a form of
Bayesianism, according to which a rational agent chooses the action that
maximizes expected payoff, where the expected payoff is calculated from the
probabilities of all payoffs for each possible action in every possible environment.
The problem is that expected payoffs are monumentally expensive to
calculate. An alternative view (Gigerenzer et al., in press) defines rationality in
terms of fast and frugal decision-making heuristics. These simple decision
rules are fast because that they are frugal in what they take into account.

(2) Ecological. Rational decision-making rules are not only cost effective, but also
adapted to specific (ecological and social) environments. Rationality is defined
by its fit to reality and not merely by an adherence to general principles of
coherence, such as logical consistence, or the probability calculus.

Boundedness is a pragmatic requirement of real-time decision making. If incoming
information requires an immediate response, such as when the sighting of a predator
requires an immediate action, then the decision mechanisms must be in place for the
decision to be fast. To be fast, they must be frugal in what they take into account.
However, fast and frugal decision rules are no good if they do not work. If simple
rules do not lead to appropriate actions then they are not adapted to their
environment, and they are not ecologically valid.
